# Core (service) for copy trading

This module will be frequently updated. Serve as listener for the target account and copy the trades to the source account.

## Development

### üîß Prerequisite: Bun Installation

Follow these instructions to install Bun JavaScript runtime ([official documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)):

```bash
# For macOS operating systems
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun

# Verify the installation by checking the version
bun --version

# Configure shell environment
# First, identify your current shell environment:
echo $SHELL

# Add the following configuration to your shell profile file (e.g., ~/.zshrc):
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

### üß™ Testing

Run the following test scripts to ensure everything is working properly:

```bash
./scripts/test-jup-client.sh        # Test Jupiter client integration
./scripts/test-parse-swap-transaction.sh  # Test swap transaction parsing
```

### üöÄ Running the Service

#### Step 1: Configure environment
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY_BASE58=<private_key_base58>  # Your private key in Base58 format
```

#### Step 2: Start the service
Use the `solRpcWsSubscribeManager` in the main function to subscribe to the target account:

```bash
./scripts/run-trade-serve.sh
```

### üì¶ Building for Production

Build the project for production deployment:

```bash
./scripts/build-trade-serve.sh
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Executing the Built Application

To run the compiled application:

```bash
./scripts/start-trade-serve.sh
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Using the CLI Interface

The service comes with an interactive CLI for managing copy trading strategies.

#### Starting the CLI

To launch the CLI interface:

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts
```

Or from the compiled version:

```bash
node dist/cli.js
```

#### Available Features

The CLI provides the following functionality:

1. **View Service Status** - Check the WebSocket connection status and active strategies
2. **List Active Strategies** - View all configured copy trading strategies
3. **Create Buy Strategy** - Set up a new strategy to copy buy trades from a target wallet
4. **Create Sell Strategy** - Set up a new strategy to copy sell trades from a target wallet
5. **Remove Strategy** - Delete an existing strategy
6. **Exit** - Gracefully shut down the service

#### Example Workflows

**Creating a Buy Strategy:**
1. Select "Create buy strategy" from the main menu
2. Enter the target wallet address to copy trades from
3. Provide a name for your strategy
4. Enter the amount of SOL to use for trades (in lamports)
5. Set your desired slippage tolerance in basis points (e.g., 100 = 1%)

**Creating a Sell Strategy:**
1. Select "Create sell strategy" from the main menu
2. Enter the target wallet address to copy trades from
3. Provide a name for your strategy
4. Set the fixed selling percentage in basis points (e.g., 500 = 5%)
5. Set your desired slippage tolerance in basis points

**Managing Strategies:**
- Use "List active strategies" to view all current strategies
- Use "Remove strategy" to delete a strategy that's no longer needed
- Use "View service status" to check the connection and activity status
